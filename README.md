# face-mask-detection-deep-learning
This project is a deep learning-based system that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using computer vision techniques. The model, which was trained on a dataset with two categories, with_mask and without_mask, achieved 98% training accuracy and 95% test accuracy. It utilizes a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. Real-time face detection and facial landmark detection are performed using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The application provides an interactive interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to either upload an image or use their webcam for prediction. The project is lightweight, efficient, and suitable for real-world deployment, such as in offices, hospitals, and public spaces.
